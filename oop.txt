            Gothons from Planet Percal #25
 ## "Aliens have invaded a space ship and our hero has
to go through a maze of rooms defeating them so he can escape into an
escape pod to the planet below. The game will be more like a Zork or
Adventure type game with text outputs and funny ways to die. The game
will involve an engine that runs a map full of rooms or scenes.
Each room will print its own description when the player enters it and
then tell the engine what room to run next out of the map."
